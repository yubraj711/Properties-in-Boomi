Definition:
Dynamic Process Property or DPP is a single instance name-value pair defined at the process level. 

Dynamic Document Property or DDP is a temporary variable associated with the document. 

i.e. If there are 100 documents in the process, then there will be 100 instances of DDP will create each associated with their respective documents. 

Both DPP and DPP are case-sensitive, So Beware of typos while accessing. 



Scope and accesibility:
DPP is defined at the process level, while DDP is defined at the document level. 

DDP set in one branch cannot be retrieved in the subsequent branch, while Once DPP defined can be accessible afterwards.

You have to set the DDP before the branch Shape to access it in all the branch paths. 



Data types:
DPP and DDP are both stored as a string. 

If you want to use numeric or any other date-type values, you need to change the data type before accessing it.



Extension and Persistence:
DPP can be extended and persisted, while DDP cannot.
